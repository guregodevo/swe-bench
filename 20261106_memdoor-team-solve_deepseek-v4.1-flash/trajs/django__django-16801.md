ImageField unnecessarily adds a post_init signal handler to the model
Description
	
While debugging some performance issues in a Django app, I found a codepath where most of the time was being spent on initializing Django models after fetching from the DB. It turns out that 30% of the time was being spent on evaluating post_init signals because we were using ImageField. However, the post_init signal handler is a noop because we don't use the width_field / height_field.
If width_field and height_field are not set, removing the post_init signal should have no effect since the signal handler will return right away. Removing this signal handler gave us a 30-40% speedup on initializing models where ImageField was used.


Do not commit, check out, reset or stash: the tree's HEAD stays where it is. Write what the task asks for as soon as you have a first version, then improve it: a turn that ends without it has done nothing. Keep no rule with the notes tool (it writes the project's AGENTS.md), and leave .memdoor/ alone.

Your answer is kept as this task's result; the tasks after it read it.

Implemented the fix.

**Change** (`django/db/models/fields/files.py`): `ImageField.contribute_to_class()` now only connects `update_dimension_fields` to the `post_init` signal when the field actually has a `width_field` or `height_field`. Without dimension fields the handler was a no-op, so this removes the per-instance signal dispatch overhead (the reported 30–40% model-init speedup) with no behavior change.

**Tests** (`tests/model_fields/test_imagefield.py`): added two regression tests verifying that an `ImageField` without dimension fields has no `post_init` receiver, while one with dimension fields still does.

**Verification**: `python runtests.py model_fields.test_imagefield` → 48 tests, OK. No commits/checkouts/resets/stashes were made.

## Prompt

ImageField unnecessarily adds a post_init signal handler to the model
Description
	
While debugging some performance issues in a Django app, I found a codepath where most of the time was being spent on initializing Django models after fetching from the DB. It turns out that 30% of the time was being spent on evaluating post_init signals because we were using ImageField. However, the post_init signal handler is a noop because we don't use the width_field / height_field.
If width_field and height_field are not set, removing the post_init signal should have no effect since the signal handler will return right away. Removing this signal handler gave us a 30-40% speedup on initializing models where ImageField was used.

## Done when

`ImageField` does not connect `update_dimension_fields` to `post_init` when both `width_field` and `height_field` are unset.
`ImageField` still connects the handler when `width_field` or `height_field` is set, preserving dimension updates.
Model initialization for an `ImageField` without width/height no longer evaluates the no-op post-init handler.

## Deliverable

## Check
`./tests/runtests.py model_fields`

## Scope
`django/db/models/fields/files.py`
`tests/model_fields/`

## Done when
`ImageField` does not connect `update_dimension_fields` to `post_init` when both `width_field` and `height_field` are unset.
`ImageField` still connects the handler when `width_field` or `height_field` is set, preserving dimension updates.
Model initialization for an `ImageField` without width/height no longer evaluates the no-op post-init handler.

## Approach
Inspect `ImageField.contribute_to_class()` in `django/db/models/fields/files.py`; the signal connection should be guarded by `if self.width_field or self.height_field:`. Add a regression test under `tests/model_fields/` that verifies no `post_init` receiver is registered for an `ImageField` with neither dimension field, while existing width/height behavior remains covered.

Candidate approaches:
1. Guard the `signals.post_init.connect(...)` call in `ImageField.contribute_to_class()` with `if self.width_field or self.height_field:`. This removes the signal entirely for the common case and is the direct fix.
2. Make `update_dimension_fields()` return early when no width/height fields are configured. This avoids work inside the handler but still pays signal dispatch overhead, so it does not address the reported performance issue.
3. Defer signal registration until a dimension field is actually used. This is more complex and risks missing updates during model initialization; the simple guard preserves existing semantics.

# The prompt

ImageField unnecessarily adds a post_init signal handler to the model
Description
	
While debugging some performance issues in a Django app, I found a codepath where most of the time was being spent on initializing Django models after fetching from the DB. It turns out that 30% of the time was being spent on evaluating post_init signals because we were using ImageField. However, the post_init signal handler is a noop because we don't use the width_field / height_field.
If width_field and height_field are not set, removing the post_init signal should have no effect since the signal handler will return right away. Removing this signal handler gave us a 30-40% speedup on initializing models where ImageField was used.

## Deliverable
changes to this tree

## Check
`./tests/runtests.py model_fields`

## Scope
`django/db/models/fields/files.py`
`tests/model_fields/`

## Done when
`ImageField` does not connect `update_dimension_fields` to `post_init` when both `width_field` and `height_field` are unset.
`ImageField` still connects the handler when `width_field` or `height_field` is set, preserving dimension updates.
Model initialization for an `ImageField` without width/height no longer evaluates the no-op post-init handler.

## Approach
Inspect `ImageField.contribute_to_class()` in `django/db/models/fields/files.py`; the signal connection should be guarded by `if self.width_field or self.height_field:`. Add a regression test under `tests/model_fields/` that verifies no `post_init` receiver is registered for an `ImageField` with neither dimension field, while existing width/height behavior remains covered.

Candidate approaches:
1. Guard the `signals.post_init.connect(...)` call in `ImageField.contribute_to_class()` with `if self.width_field or self.height_field:`. This removes the signal entirely for the common case and is the direct fix.
2. Make `update_dimension_fields()` return early when no width/height fields are configured. This avoids work inside the handler but still pays signal dispatch overhead, so it does not address the reported performance issue.
3. Defer signal registration until a dimension field is actually used. This is more complex and risks missing updates during model initialization; the simple guard preserves existing semantics.
```

### `prompt.md`

```
ImageField unnecessarily adds a post_init signal handler to the model
Description
	
While debugging some performance issues in a Django app, I found a codepath where most of the time was being spent on initializing Django models after fetching from the DB. It turns out that 30% of the time was being spent on evaluating post_init signals because we were using ImageField. However, the post_init signal handler is a noop because we don't use the width_field / height_field.
If width_field and height_field are not set, removing the post_init signal should have no effect since the signal handler will return right away. Removing this signal handler gave us a 30-40% speedup on initializing models where ImageField was used.
```

### `review.md`

```
verdict: PASS
The change in `django/db/models/fields/files.py` gates the `post_init` connection on `(self.width_field or self.height_field)`, so `ImageField` without dimension fields no longer registers the no-op `update_dimension_fields` handler, while fields with either dimension field still connect it. This matches the Done-when criteria exactly.
The added tests in `tests/model_fields/test_imagefield.py` verify both directions: no receiver for `Person` (no width/height) and a receiver for `PersonWithHeightAndWidth`. They are within scope and pass.
The check ran 457 tests with status 0 (OK, 9 skipped), so no regressions were introduced.
No files outside the stated scope were modified, and no content was removed beyond the single replaced condition line.
Dimension updates on file assignment still occur via `ImageFileDescriptor.__set__`, so removing the post-init handler for the no-dimension case does not change behavior.
